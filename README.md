# minesweeper

Hi Peeps!<br>
As the name suggests, this is a minesweeper game which I made by watching youtube videos and some basics knowledge about python. In this project, I have focused only, what we can say the backbone
the game, that is the logical part of the game and didn't bothered myself with the UI of the game. I am actually thinking of creating Android application that would include everything from UI to logic to animation(though I am not that good in it :`))
